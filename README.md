Welcome to Stemcil where we outline your stem knowledge and raise it to higher places

Our goal in this project was to help all class of people to learn Stem material without having to worry about paying for classes, textbooks, using gas, ect . . .
We believe that all knowledge shouldnt be kept from people and thats why at Stemcil we strive to provide the best of the best when it comes to free material that
would normally cost you thousands at a community college or a university.

Our site consists of 4 major catagories, these catagories are:
Science
Technology (Computer Science)
Engineering
and Mathamatics

We all know the feeling when your professor skips over something important in a lecture, or doesnt even explain it. At Stemcil we dont waste anytime, we believe in
getting you straight into the action, no more 30 minute rambles about how your professors morning went, no more "funny stories", no more nonesence. We hope you enjoy your time on our site and find it benefitial. Thank you for your time and consideration.
